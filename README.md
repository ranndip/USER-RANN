# USER-RANN

pair_style rann requires the USER-RANN package. It is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package. Additionally, if any spin fingerprint styles are used LAMMPS must be built with the SPIN package as well. Please go through the README file provided in USRE-RANN repository.

Copy User-RANN folder to the LAMMPS src/ folder.
make-serial/make-mpi to install lammps are the same as specified in the following page. https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Build_make.html
